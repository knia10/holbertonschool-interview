# 0x0E. Linear search in skip list
## Requirements
### General
- 🚩 Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- 🚩 All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- 🚩 Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`
- 🚩 All your files should end with a new line
- 🚩 Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- 🚩 You are not allowed to use global variables
- 🚩 No more than 5 functions per file
- 🚩 You are allowed to use the standard library
- 🚩 In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- 🚩 The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `search.h`
- 🚩 Don’t forget to push your header file
- 🚩 All your header files should be include guarded

### More Info
`search.h` **file**
Please define the following data structure in your `search.h` header file:

```
#ifndef _SEARCH_H_
#define _SEARCH_H_

#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>


/**
 * struct skiplist_s - Singly linked list with an express lane
 *
 * @n: Integer
 * @index: Index of the node in the list
 * @next: Pointer to the next node
 * @express: Pointer to the next node in the express lane
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure with an express lane
 * for Holberton project
 */
typedef struct skiplist_s
{
    int n;
    size_t index;
    struct skiplist_s *next;
    struct skiplist_s *express;
} skiplist_t;

skiplist_t *create_skiplist(int *array, size_t size);
void print_skiplist(const skiplist_t *list);
void free_skiplist(skiplist_t *list);
skiplist_t *linear_skip(skiplist_t *head, int value);

#endif /* _SEARCH_H_ */
